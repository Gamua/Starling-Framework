This folder contains a hidden ".idea" directory with an IntelliJ-IDEA project. That project references all modules that are part of the Starling download (i.e. Starling itself and the sample projects).

To run any of the samples in the ADL simulator, you will need to configure two external tools. To find out how to do that, have a look at the folder "util/idea".
