version 1.0 - 2012-02-24
------------------------

- reduced memory consumption a LOT by getting rid of many temporary objects
- added numerous performance enhancements (by inlining methods, removing closures, etc.)
- added 'sortChildren' method to DisplayObjectContainer, for easy child arrangement
- added 'useHandCursor' property to Sprite class
- added 'useHandCursor' activation to Button class
- added 'stage3D' property to Starling class

- added Ant build file (thanks to groves!)
